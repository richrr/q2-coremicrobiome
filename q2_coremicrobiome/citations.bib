  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling
	the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults,
	and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple
	significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected
	proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate.
	This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are
	true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control
	of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired,
	there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type
	procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent
	test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power
	is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness
	of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},
